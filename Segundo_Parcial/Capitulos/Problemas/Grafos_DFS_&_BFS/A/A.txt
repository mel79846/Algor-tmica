A network of autonomous, battery-powered, data acquisition stations has been installed to monitor the
climate in the region of Amazon. An order-dispatch station can initiate transmission of instructions to
the control stations so that they change their current parameters. To avoid overloading the battery, each
station (including the order-dispatch station) can only transmit to two other stations. The destinataries
of a station are the two closest stations. In case of draw, the first criterion is to chose the westernmost
(leftmost on the map), and the second criterion is to chose the southernmost (lowest on the map).
You are commissioned by Amazon State Government to write a program that decides if, given the
localization of each station, messages can reach all stations.

Input

The input consists of an integer N, followed by N pairs of integers Xi, Y i, indicating the localization
coordinates of each station. The first pair of coordinates determines the position of the order-dispatch
station, while the remaining N − 1 pairs are the coordinates of the other stations. The following
constraints are imposed: −20 ≤ Xi, Y i ≤ 20, and 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000. The input is terminated with N = 0.

Output

For each given expression, the output will echo a line with the indicating if all stations can be reached
or not (see sample output for the exact format).
